This is the roadmap for the game, in a rough chronological order:
Please note that GUI implementation is an aim but a looming one which may not happen for a while.

1. More countries. [PRIORITY]

2. More variation amongst countries - differences other than army size.

3. More mechanics:
    i. A taxation system [DONE]
    ii. More detailed tension system, so that above x% you get certain debuffs rather than just civil war. [DONE]
    
4. A solution to the Russia problem - if you conscript and buy soldiers at the start, you have a 1/3 chance of beating Russia and from
   there you've basically won the game. [DONE(?)]

5. Political belief system with benefits. [DONE]


AS OF 30/05/2018, I WON'T BE MAKING (M)ANY MORE CHANGES TO THE GAME CODE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.
